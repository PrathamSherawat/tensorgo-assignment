The graph compares FPS (Frames Per Second) performance between a GPU (blue line) and a CPU (red line) across a series of frames.

Observations:
GPU Performance:

The GPU consistently delivers higher FPS than the CPU, with values ranging mostly between 12 and 14 FPS.
There are fluctuations and occasional drops, but the GPU generally maintains better performance throughout the entire range.
Some notable dips drop close to 6 FPS, but these are temporary and recover quickly.
CPU Performance:

The CPU shows a lower, more stable FPS range, generally hovering between 9 and 11 FPS.
While the CPU has fewer extreme fluctuations compared to the GPU, its performance is consistently lower than the GPU.
The CPU does not show the large spikes and dips seen with the GPU, suggesting steadier but weaker performance.
Variability:

The GPU has more variability, showing sudden dips and peaks, but its average performance is superior.
The CPU has a smoother curve, indicating more consistent performance but at a lower FPS.
Conclusion:
GPU is better for high performance: It delivers higher FPS overall, making it preferable for tasks that require faster processing and rendering, like gaming, real-time simulations, or deep learning.

CPU is better for consistency: While the CPU does not reach the same FPS heights, it offers more consistent performance with fewer sudden drops, which could be useful in tasks where stability is more critical than speed.

In most cases where higher frame rates are needed, such as in graphics-heavy tasks, the GPU would be the better choice due to its higher performance. However, for tasks where frame rate stability is critical, the CPU could be considered, although it might not be as efficient.
